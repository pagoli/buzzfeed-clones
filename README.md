I used this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkQr42DmaEE) to repeat all three builds.
---
**As usual, I did adapt the original tutorial and added other technologies**
---

**Here I learnt additionally how to set up a MongoDB Server using TS, which I haven't done before**

---
Opposed to the Astra Server Setup in the tutorial.

---
**I also used VITE to create the applications**
