### Source

I used this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkQr42DmaEE) to repeat all three builds.

**As usual, I did adapt the original tutorial and added other technologies**

**Here I learnt additionally how to set up a MongoDB Server using TS, which I haven't done before**

Opposed to the Astra Server Setup in the tutorial.

**I also used VITE to create the applications**
